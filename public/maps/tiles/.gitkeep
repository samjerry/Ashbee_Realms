# This directory contains map tile images for the world grid
# Images should be named by biome ID (e.g., whispering_woods.png, town_square.png)
# Tile size: 64x64px (will be displayed at this size on the grid)
# Recommended image size: 64x64px to 256x256px PNG
# The images will appear BEHIND the grid overlay (fog, player markers, etc.)
# Use transparency for better blending with the grid UI elements
