## 🎲 Spawn Mechanics

### Spawn Chance
Each merchant has a % chance to appear when entering their spawn locations:
- **High (12-15%):** Garen, Elara, Brock - Common encounters
- **Medium (8-10%):** Thorgrim, Seraphina, Mira, Aldric, Jasper
- **Rare (5%):** Hooded Figure - Very hard to find!

### Multiple Locations
Most merchants spawn in 3-4 locations. Keep exploring to find them!

### Random Inventory
Each encounter, merchants roll for random pool items:
- Higher rarity = Lower chance
- Common items: 60-80% chance
- Rare items: 15-30% chance
- Legendary: 3-8% chance

## 🔧 For Developers

To add a new merchant:
1. Add to `data/npcs.json` → `merchants` array
2. Define `inventory_theme` (describes merchant focus)
3. Set `always_available` items (consistent stock)
4. Set `random_pool` items with spawn chances
5. Add location-appropriate `spawn_locations`
6. Set `spawn_chance` (0.05 to 0.15 typical)

**Theme Guidelines:**
- Keep items focused on merchant theme
- Mix common (high chance) with rare (low chance)
- Price appropriately for theme (specialists cheaper)
- 3-5 always items, 6-12 random pool items
